## Sections:
- Inside the spreadsheet you can see these following sections:
	1. Discrete & Continuous Distribution
	2. Sampling Distribution
	3. Point & Interval Estimate
	4. Hypothesis Testing I
	5. Hypothesis Testing II
	6. Hypothesis Testing III
	7. Regresssion Analysis I II 

**Notes:** There are still some other sections in the field of study that are not included in the spreadsheets. I only included the most significant one (my opinion).

## How to use:
- Enter your value in the **YELLOW** box, the answer then will be auto-generated in the **GREEN** box. Don't worry/ignore the **BLUE** box and also, **DO NOT DELETE** it.

- To give you more understanding what can this spreadsheet does, the 3 examples will be given (I just took it from sample final exams):

### Example 1:
A manager wants to estimate the daily revenue of a branch. A sample of daily revenues of **20 daily revenues** had **mean** revenue of **$300** and **standard deviation of $10**. Based on this sample, what is the **lower confidence limit of the 95% confidence** interval of revenues?

In the questions, these are the known given info:
- n (size) is: **20**
- sample mean is **300**
- sample standard deviation is **10**
- Confidence Interval is **95%**
- **Finding lower confidence limit?**

From this question, we know that (you have to know) using **T Distribution** since the standard deviation is from the sample (not known from the population) and the confidence interval is given which belongs to **Point & Interval Estimate** section.
